# OPENCODE_TASK_WEB
This is the Web Dev task submission for the OpenCode club from Amritanshu Barpanda

The submission is designed as a website. 
The pages are Home.html, About.html, portfolio.html and Contact.html. Please ignore the All_Text.html file.
 All the pages are connected to each other. The navigation bar on the top makes sure that we can easily navigate between the pages.

Home.html is the home page which is the introduction. It introduces Amritanshu from a third person perspective.
About.html is a breif description about the project.
portfolio.html is a breif desciption of my soft skills.
Contact.html contains contact information.

Every page other than Home.html contains a button on the bottom left corner to go back to the Home page.

Problems faced- No major problems faced. However there were 2 major overhauls.
1. I changed the background color from white to black, basically deciding to make the whole project in "dark mode" on October 11, 2023.
2. On October 14, 2023, I felt that it would be better if I created a website instead of a webpage. It would display my content more clearly and make navigation between different parts easier.

I wanted to keep a track of all the text used in the website, so the All_Text.html is a personal addition and should be ignored.

Thank You!

Your truly
Amritanshu
