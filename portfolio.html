        <div id="greetings">Greetings OpenCode, <br> 
            I recently found a great guy with a lot of potential.<br>
            Hear this everyday? Let me show you what makes this guy so special<br>
            
            This guy knows a great deal of Python. (Python is easy, huh?)<br>
            He also knows C++ (Maybe he can help in Competitive programming)<br>
            And as you can see for yourself, he knows a decent level of HTML and CSS too<br>
            Hear it from the man himself<br>
