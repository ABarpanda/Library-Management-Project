        <p id="left">Greetings OpenCode, <br> 
            I recently found a great guy with a lot of potential.<br>
            Hear this everyday? Let me show you what makes this guy so special<br>
            
            This guy knows a great deal of Python. (Python is easy, huh?)<br>
            He also knows C++ (Maybe he can help in Competitive programming)<br>
            And as you can see for yourself, he knows a decent level of HTML and CSS too<br>
            Hear it from the man himself<br>
        </p>

            Hi, I am Amritanshu Barpanda. Just like mentioned above, I specialise in HTML and CSS for web development. As of coding languages, I have learned Python from a young age. I am quite comfortable with Python and can contribute in open-source Python projects.<br>
            I have also been learning C++ language recently. <br>
            I am also familiar with the version control systems like Git and Github. I believe these skills will help me contribute to bigger projects and work in a team. I wish to be an useful part of the OpenCode club.<br>
            I am willing to dedicate hours to create amazing projects like this one. I am willing learn from the seniors and fellow club-mates. I am proven fast learner which makes me the ideal choice to include in a team.<br>
